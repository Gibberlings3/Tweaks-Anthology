This spell enables the Beast Master to attempt to summon an animal to act as <PRO_HISHER> aide and companion.

This ability affects any single animal it is cast upon. The animal receives a Save vs. Spell to avoid the effect.

If the ability recipient fails its Save vs. Spell, it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster can give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed animal by some overt action, the charm ability is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.
